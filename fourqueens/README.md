### Four Queens (N-Queens) Problem
Derived from the eight queens puzzle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

Using a backtracking algorithm, the code can solve the following problem:
- Place N number of Queens on a N x N board
- The Queens cannot be taken by other Queens, as per the standard Chess ruleset (they cannot share the same row, column or diagonal)

This will only output the first possible solution found.
